svgMotion
===================

I love making vector animations but if you're on a mobile device currently there's no app out there that allows you to make tween based animations. Desktop users have [Blender](https://blender.org/), [Synfig Studio](https://www.synfig.org/), [Keyshape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com/), [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html). If you're on a Chromebook you have [Animatron Studio](https://www.animatron.com/studio/) and even [TweenUI](https://tweenui.com/animator/) but mobile users have been left in the dark far too long. That's why I decided to build [svgMotion](https://michaelsboost.github.io/svgMotion)!
